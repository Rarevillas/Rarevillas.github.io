**Hello! and welcome to my new website!**

Making a website is pretty new, but its been pretty fun so far

Oh yes, I need to start with introductions!

My name is Rafael and today I would like to talk about some of my favorite greek heroes and gods their stories!

One of my favorite things to do to pass the time is to read about stories of other  mythologies heroes and gods


# Perceus

Oh boy, Perseus.. lets begin then, shall we?


Perseus is the son of zeus, who came due to the many affairs his father had with other mortal women, the woman in question goes by the name of Danaë, the daughter of Arcrisius WHO is also known as "he king of Argos", now Perseus came to be due to zeus turning into golden rain and impregnating Danaë, I really don't want to get into the details with this story so lets just continue with one of the deeds he did then, shall we?


# 1.Defeating Medusa

Now this one is a classic, Perseus needed Medusa's head in order to stop other men who wanted to chase after his mother but there were a couple of problems, one being that she was being guarded by 2 of her immortal sisters and two, she could turn anyone who looks at her into stone, so what he did was he attacked while they were asleep and defeated medusa by using his polished shield and his harpe, a type of sword or sickle he used his reflection to defeat medusa and beheaded her, however here was a suprise, out from Medusa's head was a winged horse known as "Pegasus" A horse described as pure white

Now, unless the story above was not enough for you, I recommend watching this video to gain more insight towards this hero

Now the thing I love about this story is that there are 2 ways to read this and one of them is really strange, some would find it a bit gross as well so of course I'm gonna go over that one first since it is my favorite.


# 1. Sea foam

Now the story goes that a woman was born due to Cronus castrating his father Uranus and throwing his testicles into the waters of Cyprus, and from the Sea foam emerged a beautiful adult woman who came with the name "Aphrodite" Now although this was a short story it still keeps me intrigued for some odd reason
