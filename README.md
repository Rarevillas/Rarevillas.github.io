Oh boy, Perseus.. lets begin then, shall we?


Perseus is the son of zeus, who came due to the many affairs his father had with other mortal women, the woman in question goes by the name of Danaë, the daughter of Arcrisius WHO is also known as "he king of Argos", now Perseus came to be due to zeus turning into golden rain and impregnating Danaë, I really don't want to get into the details with this story so lets just continue with one of the deeds he did then, shall we?


# 1.Defeating Medusa

Now this one is a classic, Perseus needed Medusa's head in order to stop other men who wanted to chase after his mother but there were a couple of problems, one being that she was being guarded by 2 of her immortal sisters and two, she could turn anyone who looks at her into stone, so what he did was he attacked while they were asleep and defeated medusa by using his polished shield and his harpe, a type of sword or sickle he used his reflection to defeat medusa and beheaded her, however here was a suprise, out from Medusa's head was a winged horse known as "Pegasus" A horse described as pure white



Aphrodites
